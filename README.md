## Adding your own service

Step - 1 : set this  ```spring.application.name=your-service-name``` in application properties (based on your need)

Step - 2  : ```eureka.client.service-url.default-zone=http://localhost:{eurekaport}/eureka``` set this in application properties too.

Step - 3 :   Add this ```		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
		</dependency>``` dependency in your pom.xml file.
    
Step - 4 : Add this lines in application.properties of the Zuul-Auth application ```zuul.routes.your-service.path=/your-service/**
zuul.routes.your-service.service-id=your-service```

Run Eureka Application first. Then Zuul-Auth then all your microservices. 

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate. Now run the application using ```mvn spring-boot:run```. ðŸ¤ž If everything is done properly the application will start at your desired port.
